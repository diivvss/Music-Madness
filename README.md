#Chord Progression/Song Generator

Project for OHI/O Hackathon 2016

This program asks the user for a key, number of chords (per chorus), and number of verses to generate a song. The chords for a chorus, a bridge, and verses are printed out as text. Chords are randomly selected, with restrictions to account for music theory rules - Ex. a preceding chord may change the next possible chord possibilities in the sequence.



##ChordProgression.jar
  
  -On Windows/Mac/Linux: executable from command line "(java app location) -jar (ChordProgression.jar location)"
  
  -should work on other devices with Java VM (untested)
  
  <br>
##ChordProgression.apk
  
  -Android port available, Download and install to your device with the given .apk
  
  -Because the .apk is currently unsigned, application installs from external sources must be enabled on your device
  
  -Note: Early development version - error checking improvements coming

##Future goals:

  -Option to show the chord chart/tab for guitar, piano sheet music
  
  -Sound output for each chord
