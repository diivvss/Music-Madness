#Chord Progression/Song Generator

Project for OHI/O Hackathon 2016

-asks the user for the key they want the generated song in, prints out resulting Chorus, Verses, and Bridge Chords (as text)

##ChordProgression.jar
  
  -On Windows/Mac/Linux: executable from command line "(java app location) -jar (ChordProgression.jar location)"
  
  -should work on other devices with Java VM (untested)
  
  <br>
##ChordProgression.apk
  
  -Android port available, Download and install to your device with the given .apk
  
  -Because the .apk is currently unsigned, application installs from external sources must be enabled on your device
  
  -Note: Early development version - error checking improvements coming
  
  <br>
##Future goals:

  -Option to show the chord chart/tab for guitar, piano sheet music
  
  -Sound output for each chord
